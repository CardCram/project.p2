This app allows the user to create flash cards to help study. The user can create separate decks for each subject of study, create flash cards with questions and answers to those questions, and delete decks and cards. The user can also make use of pre-made flash cards. The user can view cards they have made and see the answer, which has been rendered invisible until highlighted through the use of CSS.
